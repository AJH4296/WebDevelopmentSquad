# What is JavaScript?? 

## Goal

To understand the history of JavaScript and why it is one of the best web programming languages to use today. You will learn more about variables, datatypes and conditionals by slowly put together the building blocks of what it means to build a beautiful yet functional website.

## So.. where did it all start?  
Inspired by Java, **JavaScript** was created in 1995 by Brendan Eich. It is the standard programming language for Web. It's the highest language used by millions of developers today (this includes myself). 


## It's JavaScript, not Java ?? 

Yes, JavaScript and Java are two different programming languages that have two different designs and capabilities. 

Despite the similar names,  **JavaScript** is widely known to be a "scripting language" for the cilent-side of the browser, it is what adds in the behavior of a website and **Java** is mostly known to be used as a compiling language for virtual machines. 

A lot of people tend to confuse the two but we don't want you to make that same mistake. 


## Why JavaScript is so unique 

JavaScript is greatly known for building fast and high-performing web, desktop, mobile apps and browser extensions. 

*"Any application that can be written in JavaScript, will eventually be written in JavaScript" - Jeff Atwood , Founder of StackOverflow*

* Easiest program language to learn for beginners. 

* Popular By Demand

* Interactive, Fun, and Has Created Other Platforms To Build Mobile-Friendly Apps. 


## Apps..Websites..and Games that were built using Javascript.
