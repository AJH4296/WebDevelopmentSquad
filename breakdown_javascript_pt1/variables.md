## Variables in JavaScript 


## What is a variable ?
A **variable** is a container that allows you to store some type of data/value inside of it. This can be any datatype such as a string, number/integer, object, array, etc. All programming languages have their own way of declaring/defining a variable but the concept remains the same. 


## How do we define it? 
In **JavaScript** the way that we declare a variable is by using the word `var`. This statement is followed by the `variableName` and set to the `data/value` type that you want it to be. 

For Example: 

`var favoriteColor = 'Blue';`

`var` = declaring the variable , `favoriteColor` = the variable's name , `'Blue'` = is the string value that I wanted it to be. 


Other Examples: 

`var favoriteNumber = 3;`

`var groceries = ['apples', 'bread', 'milk', 'eggs', cheese'];` 


## Why is it useful in programming? 
**Variables** are useful in programming because it allows you to keep track of information and it creates a way for you to refer back to it later on in your code. It also helps the computer to store it within it's memory as well.


## Let's Try It Out! 

**Exercise 1: Want to find out how old you'll be? Calculate it!**

* Store your birth year in a variable.
* Store a future year in a variable.
* Calculate your 2 possible ages for that year based on the stored values.

`For example, if you were born in 1988, then in 2026 you'll be either 37 or 38, depending on what month it is in 2026. Output them to the screen like so: "I will be either NN or NN in YYYY", substituting the values.`


**Exercise 2: It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.**

* Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
* Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
* Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C ".
