## How Can We Write In Javascript  

A **computer program** is a list of "instructions" to be "executed" by a computer. 

In a programming language, these programming instructions are called **statements** 

The **JavaScript progam** is just a list of progamming statements. 


*Think of the steps you have to take in order to complete a certain tasks. For example: Making a PB & J sandwhich, doing laundry,etc. It is the same thing with programming a computer* 

## Statements Vs. Expressions 

To understand JavaScript's syntax, first you have to understand the difference between writing a statement and writing an expression. 


**Statements** "do things". A program is a sequence of statements as it is explained above. 

**Expressions** produces a value of something. These are function arguments. For an exmaple: 

` 3 * 7 ` 

` 7 + 2 ` 

## JavaScript Syntax 



## Semicolons 
In JavaScript you want to make it a habit to practice putting a semi-colon after every new line of code that you create. 

Different programming language will have a different style of writing their code. For example: This is acceptable in JavaScript: 

`var message = 'Hello World';` 

However, In Python semi-colons aren't needed after 
`def message = 'Hello World' ` 


## Comments 

While coding you may sometimes need to make comments to explain the code that you have written or comment out things that you do not need at the moment, if you want to test something out. 


## Single-Line Comments 
Any text between // and the end of the line will be ignored by Javascript. 


`var x = 10  		//Declare x, gives you the value of 10` 
`var y =  x + 3  	//Declare y, gives you the value x + 3 which is equal to 13`


## Multi-line Comments 

These will comment out several lines of code for you. A good tip is for you to highlight what you want to comment out and press `command ` + `/` on your keyboard. 

`/* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor. Aenean massa. Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus.
