## Hello folks. I want you to ENJOY the PRESENT. With Whipppo!


## Description for Whipppo
Site showing EVERYTHING TAUGHT thus far

### Before I make a site I go over these first steps:
- Figure out wtf I am gonna do
- What info do I need to collect? External resources?
- Where will the site be hosted? Unique URL? Bought from where?
- Graphics, color scheme, multimedia?
- Pages to create
- What info will the user give, if any? What will the user take away overall?

### Site pages: Single Page Application

### 5 sections: Header, footer, API demos, JS/Python API connecting techniques, and additional resources

### APIs I will use eventually:
- NYTimes
- Studio Ghibli
- Open Weather Maps
- Google Maps
- Spotify
- Giphy
- GiantBomb
- Twitch
- MTA
- Braintree
