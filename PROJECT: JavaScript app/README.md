## REMEMBER these Git branch commands:
- git checkout <branchname>
		   Switch the current branch to the  <branchname> you specified
- git branch -m, --move
           Move/rename a branch and the corresponding reflog.
- git branch -M
           Shortcut for --move --force.
- git branch --color[=<when>]
           Color branches to highlight current, local, and remote-tracking
           branches. The value must be always (the default), never, or auto.
- git branch [--list | -a, --all]
           List the branches, OR both remote-tracking branches and local branches.
- git branch <branchname>
           The name of the branch to create or delete. The new branch name
           must pass all checks defined by git-check-ref-format(1). Some of
           these checks may restrict the characters allowed in a branch name.
- git branch -D <branchname>
		   Delete the  <branchname> branch even if the "master" branch (or
           whichever branch is currently checked out) does not have all
           commits from the test branch.

Here are some examples:
$ git branch my2.6.14 v2.6.14
$ git checkout my2.6.14
$ git branch -D test
