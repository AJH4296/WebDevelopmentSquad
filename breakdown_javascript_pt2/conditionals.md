## Conditionals in JS 

## What is a conditional?

A **conditional** in progamming are statements that's used to perform different actions based on different conditions.


## How does If.. Else statements work? 

In JavaScript, the **if and else** statement is used to specify a block of code to be executed. For example, **if** this condition is **true** then we will tell the computer to do something. **else** we will tell the computer to do something else instead because this condition was **false**. **Else if** can be added to specify a new condition only if the first condition turned out to be **false**. 

	   function funFacts(num){
			if(num < 10){
				console.log('Whoah that's a pretty small number')
			}
			else{
				console.log('Woah dude chill with those numbers')
			}
		}



## Why are they useful in programming? 

**Conditional** statements like IF.. Else.. allows programmers the ability to test a variable against a value and act in one way if the condition is met by the variable or another way if it's not using logical operators like..`=== (equal to value and equal type)`, `== (Equal to)`, `> (Greater Than)`, `< (Less Than)`, `>= (Greater than or Equal to)`,  `<= (Less than or Equal to)`
