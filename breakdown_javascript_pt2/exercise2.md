* Define a function called **lowerCaseAll** that takes in a word and returns the words with all of it's letters being lowercased. 

`For Example: lowerCaseAll('TheBlueMoon'); //returns ---> thebluemoon` 



* Define a function called **capitalizeAll** that takes in a word and returns the words with all of it's letters being lowercased. 

`For Example: capitalizeAll('goodLuck!'); //returns ---> GOODLUCK!` 


* Create a function called **verbing**. It should take a single argument, a string. **If its length is at least 3**, it should **add 'ing'to its end**, unless it already ends in 'ing', in which case it should add 'ly' instead. **If the string length is less than 3, it should leave it unchanged.**

`For Example: verbing('swim') ---> 'swimming'`
