## CSS Group Project 

## Project Goal 

To build one of the following projects listed down below. In your assigned groups, you and your teammate will use the pair-programming method to practice taking turns coding out this project together. **For example: someone will build out the HTML page and someone add the styling by writing out the CSS. Both should be guiding each other during the process.**

## Goal for Pair-Programming 

 Pair-Programming is a great way for you to learn how to code with the person sitting next to you. It creates an enviornment where making mistakes or not understanding something is okay. It will allow you and the other person to solve these problems together versus on your own. 

## List of Projects(Choose 1)

* CookBook/Recipe Website

* Elemntary School Website

* Small Business Website 


## Deadline 

This project must be submitted **before class on Wednesday**. It will be your job to make sure that you created a new repoistory for this project, commit your final changes and push them to github. Once you have done so, you can **send me the link of that project repo via Slack.**
