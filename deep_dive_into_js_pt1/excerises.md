# JS Array & Object Exercises 

## Goal

To help you get a better understanding of how arrays and objects work in JavaScript. This will give you the space to practice that you need to become a  master in JavaScript. 


## Arrays Exercises 

* Create a function called `firstElement` that takes an array and prints out the first element within the array. 

* Create a function called `lastElement` that takes an array and prints out the last element within the array. 

* Create a function called `middleElement` that takes an array and prints out the middle element within the array. 

* Create a variable called `arrayOne` which holds these values `'apples'`, `'oranges'`, `'grapes'`. Create another variables called `arrayTwo` which holds these following values `'kiwi'`, `'pears'`, `'pineapples'`, `'strawberries'`. Now, using one of the array built-in methods, return a new array containing these values of the joined arrays. 

The output should look be this down below: 
		`['apples', 'oranges', 'grapes', 'kiwi', 'pears', 'pineapples', 'strawberries']`

Try to practice using more built-in array methods on your own. 


## Object Exercises 

* Create an object that has some information about yourself, including your name, hometown, favorite food, and favorite musical artist. Feel free to add any other properties you'd like.
		`
		var tionna = {
			name: 'Tionna', 
			hometown: 'Brooklyn, NY', 
			favorite_food: 'Ziti', 
			favorite_artist: 'H.E.R'
		}
		`


* Create an object to hold information on your favorite recipe. It should have properties for title (a string), servings (a number), and ingredients (an array of strings).On separate lines (one console.log statement for each), log the recipe information so it looks like:

		Mole
		Serves: 2
		Ingredients:
		cinnamon
		cumin
		cocoa


* Create an array of objects, where each object describes a book and has properties for the title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).
Iterate through the array of books using a `for loop` and for each book, print out the book title and book author like so: 

		"The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

* Create a function named `getObjName` that takes in an object as an argument. The function return the value of the name property of the object.

Examples: 

		getObjName({name: 'Jimi', insrument: 'guitar'});  // returns 'Jimi'
		getObjName({name: 'Snorlax', type: 'normal'});  // returns 'Snorlax'
