Yes folks, we are here. The second major half of this program's code lessons: Python. 

Python is a high-level (further away from machine language and easier for programmers to understand) general-purpose OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) programming language; It's powerful in its classes and other data structures like lists and dictionaries; Mapping and filtering capabilities; JSON implementation (great option for connecting to API sources), etc. 

We're in a GREAT place to begin learning Python because we have been making functions, working with conditionals and loops, and have a little taste in making OBJECTS! Much of what you learn in Python will make your JS knowledge STRONGER because they're both scripting languages.

Note: Scripts are run-time, environment-specific programs we make to automate simple tasks like API calls, running human-like events on Graphical User Interfaces or GUIs, 




Quora uses Python. Google uses Python. YouTube. Spotify. Hipmunk. MANY more. And those are just WEB applications. If you heard of Django and Flask then you're already familiar with two of the most widely used web development frameworks... Created in Python. Python can also be used for desktop software like PC games, Dropbox, Totem, etc., or for mainframe functionality.




Machine learning, right? Machine learning is actually relevant to some of the projects our cohort is making: finding in photos the clothing of one brand or designer and ignoring all other possibilities, finding security in users' job-seeking or advice-giving profiles by using facial recognition, finding offensive language and curses in forums and other kinds of posts. 

These scenarios involve creating algorithms for the *detection* of something YOU outline in an interpreted language like Python, into the lower level that is machine code. If you're interested in learning more please read up on the really cool Python-based framework/library [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) and the Python library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html).



We're going to now check out [the official website of this programming language, from the Python Software Foundation](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide).


If you ever [have trouble working Python on Windows check here first](https://docs.python.org/3/faq/windows.html#how-do-i-run-a-python-program-under-windows). Skim the page and see if your issue is there somewhere (or search for keywords).
