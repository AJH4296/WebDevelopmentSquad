Yup. Files.


##FILES!

Make sure to create your file names with ONLY [az][AZ][09][_] characters, no spaces or dashes or any other special characters


open() - Takes two parameters: The file path and file name, and the mode whether it's 
    - r for reading the content from the file
    - w for writing to the file
    - a for appending to the file
    - r+ for reading and writing to the file

.read() - Retrieve all of the content in a file
.write() - Writes stuff to an opened file
.mode - Is it readable? Writeable? Appendable
If you want to read all the lines of a file in a list you can also use list(), readline(), or readlines() for retrieving more than one line.
.close()
